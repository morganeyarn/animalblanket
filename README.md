Ideas backlog
- dark theme / system theme
- calculation of final dimensions - done
- yarn list and amount calculation - done
- layout and configuration presets + theme presets (“Soft Pastels”, “Woodland”, "cow blanket")
- maintain squares position on layout update - done

- Auto-save to browser (localStorage) + “Restore last session”
- Shareable link (encode design into URL)
- Centralize “apply layout to UI”
- Improve export reliability: include version so future schema changes won’t break older saves
